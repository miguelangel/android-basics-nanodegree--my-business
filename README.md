#Project Overview
Design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the lines of your favorite coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.

#Suggested App Ideas
 - Details about a small business in your neighborhood
 - Contact info and description about your workplace or school
 - Info about a special interest group (like a club or sports team) youâ€™re part of and how new members can sign up

#Requirements
Your design must include:

 - Business name
 - At least one photo representing the business
 - Two or more other pieces of information, such as:
	 - Contact information for the business (eg phone number, email address, website)
	 - Address of the Business
	 - Description of business
	 - Hours of operation
